# Nav
  The search bar is the main component which handles mispelling, and autocorrecting in terms of relevance to the items that are within the MYSQL database used. This is a microservice, meaning that this component is capable of rendering on its own as well as dispatching the product id upon searching an item. The navbar uses ReactJS for the client-side rendering while the backend is built with Node.js(Express) along with a remote Database using MYSQL.
